# mf-static-comp-2

This project aims to recreate a static site based on a provided comp. Liberties were taken with the design re: colors, icons, and photos, but not with the layout. The site aims to be responsive at several separate breakpoints and the layout has been considered at these breakpoints to maximize ease of use.
